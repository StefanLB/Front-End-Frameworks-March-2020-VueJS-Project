# Front-End-Frameworks-March-2020-VueJS-Project
SoftUni Front-end Frameworks Individual Project Assignment



## [Scrollol](https://scrollol-66fd7.web.app/)

### Project Summary

This **Vue.js 2.6** application represents an **entertainment platform** which can be accessed by both anonymous and registered users for the **purpose of sharing content *(images/gifs)***.

When creating a Lol *(post)*, the user provides details regarding it *(such as title, description, image URL)*, as well as a category. Lols can be modified *(liked/disliked/commented/deleted)*. Each user can only like/dislike a specific post once and the actions are mutually exclusive. While browsing, users can filter by category *(a list of all available categories is provided in the left navigation bar)*. Comments can be added to Lols, provided the user is authenticated. Once a comment is added, it can only be deleted by its creator. Users can view and update their profiles, as well as review all their posted Lols. Each user has stats, consisting of: number of posts, total points *(likes-dislikes)*, total likes, total dislikes, total comments received.
